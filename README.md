# STAC

This repository contains a jupyter notebook with python code for creating a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec>. I am primarily using the package pystac <https://pystac.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>. The python code creates a STAC catalog which consists of nesting json files used to describe geospatial data assets. I am serving the jupyter notebook in Cyverse Discovery Environment and developing the code there. Periodically, I push code changes to this repo.
